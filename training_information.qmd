The goal of this workshop is to equip participants with the ability to recognize and produce data visualizations in accordance with the best practices of the field. Looking forward to meeting you all!

## Venue

The workshop takes place at the **Kigali Marriott Hotel in Kigali, Rwanda on April 19th 2024**. We will begin at 9:30am and finish at 1pm (see schedule below). If you have had any trouble with software installation, **please arrive 15 minutes prior to the beginning of the session** so we can assist you.

## Before the Workshop

Please install R, RStudio, and the `ggplot2` library following these [installation instructions](Getting_started_with_R.qmd). If you have any trouble installing we will have a station on 18th April where you can come for assistance. Installation might take 15 minutes or more even on a good internet connection, so please install ahead of time!

Please also **download [the data](Mabangata_Incidence_2018.RData) we will be using for the workshop** ahead of time. You should also receive this data as an attachment in your email. If you are having trouble downloading the data, please put a red sticky note on your computer and we will assist you.
