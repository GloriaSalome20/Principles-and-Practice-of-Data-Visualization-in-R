```{r echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read.csv("Mabangata_region_incidence2018.csv")
df$date_tested <- as.Date(df$date_tested,"%m/%d/%Y")
df_und5<- df %>% filter(age_group=="u5") 
```


## Main Objective

At the end of the training we will be able to produce this plot:

```{r echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested, y= incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Month", 
       y="Incidence (Cases/100,000)",
       title="Malaria Incidence, Mabangata Region, 2018",
       colour="Age Group") +
  theme_bw() 
  # theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5),
  #       axis.text.x = element_text(angle=45,hjust=1)) +
  # scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 month", date_labels = "%B")
```

## `ggplot2`: A Layered Approach to Plotting

::: callout-tip
### Aim:
-   Learn about the layered approach of ggplot.
-   Understand how each layer adds elements to the plot.
:::

The `ggplot` library is a powerful tool for creating data visualizations in R. It follows a layered approach to building plots, where each layer adds additional elements to the plot. Understanding how ggplot works can help you create sophisticated and informative visualizations.

In ggplot, you start with a base plot and add layers called "geometries", or `geom`s. Each layer in ggplot adds a different aspect to the plot, allowing you to customize and enhance the visualization. Once geoms have been added, labels and other customizations can be added in a similar way.

::: panel-tabset

### Base Plot: No Information

Every plot in ggplot starts with the function `ggplot`. With no additional information about what to display, it will simply show a grey box:

```{r}
ggplot()
```

### Base Plot: With Data

The ggplot function must include an argument to the dataset we want to plot. Here, we specify that we want to use the `df_und5` dataset. But because we have not told the function *which* columns to plot, it will still only show a grey box:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5)
```


### Base Plot: With `x` and `y`

Let's say we want to plot the `date_tested` and `incidence` columns, with `date_tested` on the x axis and `incidence` on the y axis. For this, we have to use a function called `aes()`. We'll explain it later, but for now just type in the code. Now, on top of our grey box, there is a layer showing some line breaks and labels mapping our x and y variables. Progress!

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))
```

### Adding Points

Now we're finally ready to add shapes to our plot using `geom`s. If we want to represent this data using *points* we use the function `geom_point()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_point()
```

### Adding Lines

As an additional layer on top of this, we use the function `geom_line()` to add a line plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line()
```

:::

The order in which you append your geoms to the main `ggplot` function matters: whatever you list first will go underneath whatever comes next. For example, observe the difference between these two pieces of code and the plots they produce:

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(size=2) +
  geom_point(colour="red", size=4) 

ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_point(colour="red", size=4) +
  geom_line(size=2)
```

::: callout-tip
### Note:

It's easy and fun to switch layers around in ggplot, but watch out for any dangling `+` signs at the end of your plots! If you leave a `+` dangling at the end like this, your code will think that you're still typing your command and won't show your plot:

```
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(size=2) +
  geom_point(colour="red", size=4) +
```

Conversely, if you miss a `+` in the middle, your code will only show you the first part of your plot, then throw an error:

```
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(size=2) 
  geom_point(colour="red", size=4) 
```

:::


::: callout-tip
### Exercise

Change the code below so that the orange points are in front of the blue lines. Watch out for any missing or dangling `+` signs!

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_point(colour="orange", size=4) + 
  geom_line(colour="blue", size=2) 
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Solution
```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(colour="blue", size=2) +
  geom_point(colour="orange", size=4)  
  
```

:::


## Customizing `geom`s

::: callout-tip
### Aim:
-   Adjust the color, size, shape, and linetype of geom features
:::

As we've hinted at already in the plots above, you can change the features of your `geom`s by adding arguments inside of their specific functions. You can see the defaults if you enter these geoms with no additonal arguments:

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_line() + 
  geom_point() 
```

Some features, such as color and size, are used by both `geom_point()` and `geom_line()`:

```{r}
ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(colour="blue", size=2) 

ggplot(data=df_und5, aes(x=date_tested, y=incidence)) +
  geom_point(colour="blue", size=2)  

```

Others are specific to specific geoms, as in the examples below:

::: panel-tabset

## `linetype` for Lines

Options include "blank", "solid", "dashed", "dotted", "dotdash", "longdash", and "twodash".

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_line(colour="blue", size=2, linetype="dashed")
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_line(colour="red",size=3,linetype="dotted")
```

## `shape` for Points

Shapes can take any number from 1 to 25. 

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_point(colour="blue", size=2, shape=2)
```

```{r}

ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_point(colour="red", size=3, shape=4)
```

:::

You can layer these as before:

```{r}

ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_line(colour="blue",size=2,linetype="dotted") +
  geom_point(colour="red", size=3, shape=4)
```


::: callout-tip
### Exercise:

Modify the code below so that:

- the line is orange, dashed, and size 2
- the points are green, shape 16, and size 4

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_line(colour="blue",size=2,linetype="dotted") +
  geom_point(colour="red", size=3, shape=4)
```

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Solution
```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence))+ 
  geom_line(colour="orange",size=2,linetype="dashed") +
  geom_point(colour="green", size=4, shape=16)
```

## Mapping Aesthetics with the `aes()` Function

::: callout-tip
### Aim:

-   Understand the role of the aes function in ggplot.
-   Learn when to use aes to map variables to aesthetics.
:::

In the presentation, we learned that all visualizations are **mappings** of information from  abstract numbers into visual concepts like location, shape, color, etc.

The `aes()` function is used whenever we want to map variables in our dataset to aesthetic properties such as x and y axes, colors, shapes, etc. It is one of the most confusing aspects of ggplot, but also one of the most powerful once you get used to it. 

### `x` and `y`

`aes()` can take many arguments (see the documentation for a full list), but you've already seen the most crucial ones: `x` and `y`. These arguments are always necessary for ggplot to understand which variables to show on the two-dimensional screen.

::: panel-tabset
### Switching `x` and `y`

the aes in the base position and altering the variables of x axis and y axis

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
    geom_point()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = incidence, y = date_tested,)) +
    geom_point()
```

### Different `x` and `y`

```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = pop)) +
    geom_point()
```

:::


::: callout-tip
### Exercise

Create a scatter plot using the `df_und5` dataset, with date (`date_tested`) on the x axis and  confirmed cases (`conf`) on the y axis.

:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Solution
```{r}
ggplot(data = df_und5, aes(x = date_tested, y = conf)) +
    geom_point()
```

:::


### Color

To understand mappings beyond `x` and `y`, let's move away from the `df_und5` dataset and start using the full `df` dataset. We can start with a simple scatter plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
  geom_point( )
```

Now, instead of a single time series, we have three time series: one for each age group. But it's hard to differentiate them right now because they're all the same shape and size. It would be nice if we could make each age group a different color, using the `age_group` column name. How do you think we could do this?

Let's try a few options:
```
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
  geom_point(colour=age_group)
```

```
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
  geom_point(colour="age_group")
```

Neither of these works, because we are *mapping* a variable in our dataset to a feature of our plot (here, color). So we need to put color inside an `aes()` function within our geom:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=age_group))
```

A ton of cool things just happened! Ggplot turned each age group a different color, picked some nice default colors, and gave us a helpful legend. We can do the same with a line plot:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=age_group))
```


### Other Aesthetics

We can take any of the variables we used outside of `aes` and map them to variables inside of `aes`:

::: panel-tabset
### Color

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour=age_group))
```

### Shape

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence))+
  geom_point(aes(shape=age_group))
```

### Size

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence))+
  geom_point(aes(size=age_group))
```

### Linetype

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(linetype=age_group))
```

:::

::: callout-tip
### Exercise:

Create the following plot:
![](images/line_size_exercise.png)
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Solution:
```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(size=age_group))
```

:::


::: callout-tip
## Note

When you map a color to a continuous variable instead of a categorical one, the color scheme changes to something continuous:

```{r}
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = date_tested, y = incidence, color = incidence)) +
  geom_point()
```

There are many, many ways to customize the colors of your plots. Going into detail is beyond the scope of this workshop.

## Mixing and Matching Aesthetics

You can put multiple aesthetics inside of one `aes` function:

::: panel-tabset
## Same Variable

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence))+
  geom_point(aes(size=age_group, colour=age_group))
```

## Different Variables

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence))+
  geom_point(aes(size=incidence, shape=age_group))
```

## Different Variables in Different `geom`s

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(aes(colour=age_group)) +
  geom_point(aes(size=incidence, shape=age_group))
```
::: callout-tip

  geom_point()
```

## Customizing Plots for Presentation and Publication

::: callout-tip
### Aim:
Learn how to customize plots for presentation and publication. Adjust plot elements such as titles, labels, themes, and scales.
:::

With our last exercise, we almost created our goal plot for the session:
```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested,y=incidence)) +
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point()
```

All that's left to do is adjust the themes and labeling. 

Customizing plots is essential for making them more visually appealing and informative for presentation or publication.

Elements such as titles, axis labels, and themes can be customized to enhance readability and aesthetics. Scales can be adjusted to ensure that the data is displayed in a clear and meaningful way.

::: panel-tabset
## Theme

There are a number of different built-in themes you can select to modify the background color and overall appearance of your plot.

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested, y= incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_dark()
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested, y= incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_bw()
```

## Title and Axis Labels

You can use the `labs` function to modify the axis labels, legend labels, and title:

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested, y= incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Month", 
       y="Incidence") 
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested, y= incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x="Month", 
       y="Incidence",
       title="Malaria 2018",
       color="Age Group") 
```

:::


::: callout-tip
### Exercise:

Create the following plot:

![](images/final_image.png)
:::

::: {.callout-tip collapse=true}
### Solution
```{r}
ggplot(data=df,aes(x=date_tested, y= incidence))+
  geom_line(aes(color=age_group)) +
  geom_point()+
  labs(x="Month", 
       y="Incidence (Cases/100,000)",
       title="Malaria Incidence, Mabangata Region, 2018",
       colour="Age Group") +
  theme_bw() 
```

And there it is! We've gone from a set of numbers on a page to a nice, polished figure ready for a presentation. 

We've only scratched the surface of what you can do with `ggplot2` today, but we hope we've given you a strong basis and you'll be able to learn more in the future!
