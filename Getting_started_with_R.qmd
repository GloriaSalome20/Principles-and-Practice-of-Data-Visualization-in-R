**DOWNLOAD R**

Visit the [Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN)](https://cran.r-project.org/mirrors.html) to download R which is a network of servers around the world that store identical up-to-date versions of code and documentation for R. {{< pagebreak >}}

::: callout-tip
Selecting a mirror that is close to you may help speed up the download. You can still use another mirror since the closest geographic location does not always give the best mirror.

## Install and setup RStudio Desktop

**Rstudio** is an integrated development environment (IDE) for R, providing a user-friendly interface for R programming.

::: callout-tip
### Note

RStudio is moving away from its R-exclusive focus and becoming Posit in October 2022 to enable broader data science, scientific research, and technical communication functionalities and, in particular, to integrate Python users.
:::

::: callout-tip
### Important

In order for RStudio desktop to work with R you must have installed R on your computer, see Section A.1. RStudio does not include R when you download and install it.

### Note

A R package is a collection of functions, data, and compiled code in a well-defined format, created to add specific functionality to R.

There are 10,000+ user contributed packages and growing.

There is a set of standard (or base) packages which is considered part of the R source code and automatically available as part of your R installation. Base packages contain the basic functions that allow R to work, and enable standard statistical and graphical functions on data sets.
